Quick Start:

	To use this program, all you have to do is run entertainment_center.py! The webpage will be created and displayed on your web browser. If you'd like to edit the movies, all movie objects are contained in entertainment_center.py.
	
Requirements:

	The only requirement is to have Python installed along with a modern web browser. This program has been tested with Python 3.6.0 and Python 2.7.12.
	
Contents:

	The files contained are entertainment_center.py, which contains all movie objects, fresh_tomatoes.py, which builds the webpage after being passed the movie objects, and media.py, which initializes the Movie class.
	
Changes:

	From the original fresh_tomatoes.py file provided, a few changes have been made. h2 was set to a few font points smaller than default, as having two lines of text on some movie titles messed up the layout of the page. The title of the page was also changed, along with the text of the link in the top menu bar.
